# Galaxy-Operator
The official operator for [Galaxy](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng).

Latest Release: [github.com/ansible/galaxy-operator/releases/latest](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-operator/releases/latest)

Galaxy-Operator uses the [Ansible Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/).

# Images
Galaxy-Operator images are automatically built by our CI and [hosted on quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/ansible/galaxy-operator).

Note that Galaxy-Operator requires three separate images (the operator, the main galaxy service, and the web interface):

| Operator | Service | UI |
| -------- | ---- | --- |
| [galaxy-operator](https://quay.io/repository/ansible/galaxy-operator?tab=tags) |[galaxy-ng](https://quay.io/repository/ansible/galaxy-ng?tab=tags) | [galaxy-ui](https://quay.io/repository/ansible/galaxy-ui?tab=tags) |

## Custom Resource Definitions
Galaxy-Operator currently provides three different kinds of [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources): Galaxy, Galaxy Backup and Galaxy Restore.

### Galaxy (galaxies.galaxy.ansible.com)
Manages the Galaxy application and its deployments, services, etc.

### Galaxy Backup (galaxybackups.galaxy.ansible.com)

### Galaxy Restore (galaxyrestores.galaxy.ansible.com)

# Galaxy
With Galaxy you can:

* Host your Ansible Collections
* Host execution environment (EE) and decision environments (DE)
* Locally mirror all of, or a subset of your collections, execution environments, and decision environments
* Manage content from multiple sources in one place
* Promote content through different repos in an organized way

If you have dozens, hundreds, or thousands of collections and execution environments and need a better way to manage them, Galaxy can help.

Galaxy is completely free and open-source!
